description: "The Tale of Mr. Jeremy Fisher is a children's book, written and illustrated\
  \ by Beatrix Potter. It was published by Frederick Warne & Co. in July 1906. Jeremy's\
  \ origin lies in a letter she wrote to a child in 1893. She revised it in 1906,\
  \ and moved its setting from the River Tay to the English Lake District. The tale\
  \ reflects her love for the Lake District and her admiration for children's illustrator\
  \ Randolph Caldecott.\nJeremy Fisher is a frog who lives in a \"slippy-sloppy\"\
  \ house at the edge of a pond. One rainy day he collects worms for fishing, and\
  \ sets off across the pond on his lily-pad boat. He plans to invite his friends\
  \ for dinner if he catches more than five minnows. He encounters all sorts of setbacks\
  \ to his goal, and escapes a large trout who tries to swallow him. He swims for\
  \ shore, decides he will not go fishing again, and hops home.\nPotter's tale pays\
  \ homage to the leisurely summers her father and his companions passed sport fishing\
  \ at rented country estates in Scotland. Following the tale's publication, a child\
  \ fan wrote to Potter suggesting Jeremy find a wife. Potter responded with a series\
  \ of miniature letters on the theme as if from Jeremy and his pals. After Potter's\
  \ death in 1943, licences were issued to various firms to produce the Potter characters.\
  \ Jeremy and his friends were released as porcelain figurines, plush toys, and other\
  \ merchandise.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
